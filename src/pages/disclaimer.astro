          <h2>No Legal Advice</h2>
          <p>
            The information provided on Motorcycle Wreck Law (motorcyclewrecklaw.com) is for general informational purposes only 
            and is not intended to be legal advice. This website is not a law firm and does not provide legal services.
          </p>
          <p>
            You should not act or refrain from acting based on any information on this website without first consulting with a 
            licensed attorney who can evaluate your specific circumstances.
          </p>

          <h2>No Attorney-Client Relationship</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Using this website does not create an attorney-client relationship.</strong> Submitting a contact form, 
            requesting a consultation, or communicating through this website does not establish an attorney-client relationship 
            with Motorcycle Wreck Law or any attorney in our network.
          </p>
          <p>
            An attorney-client relationship is only created when you have signed a written agreement with a specific attorney 
            who has agreed to represent you.
          </p>

          <h2>Confidentiality Warning</h2>
          <p>
            Information submitted through this website is NOT protected by attorney-client privilege until an attorney agrees 
            to represent you and you sign a retainer agreement. Do not send confidential information until an attorney-client 
            relationship has been established.
          </p>

          <h2>No Guarantees of Results</h2>
          <p>
            Past case results, settlement amounts, and verdicts discussed on this website do not guarantee similar results in your case. 
            Every legal matter depends on its specific facts and circumstances. The outcome of any case depends on numerous factors 
            beyond anyone's control.
          </p>

          <h2>Attorney Advertising</h2>
          <p>

            website are licensed in specific states and can only represent clients in matters within their licensed jurisdictions.

          <h2>Third-Party Attorney Relationships</h2>
          <p>
            Motorcycle Wreck Law connects potential clients with independent attorneys. We do not control these attorneys' actions, 
            conduct, or legal representation. Each attorney operates their own practice and makes their own decisions about 
            case acceptance, strategy, and fees.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are solely responsible for evaluating and selecting any attorney. We encourage you to verify any attorney's 
            credentials, disciplinary history, and experience before hiring them.
          </p>
