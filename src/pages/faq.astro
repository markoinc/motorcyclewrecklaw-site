  {
    question: "How much does it cost to hire a motorcycle accident lawyer?",
    answer: "Most motorcycle accident attorneys work on a contingency fee basis, meaning you pay nothing upfront and no fees unless you win your case. The attorney's fee is typically a percentage (usually 33-40%) of your settlement or verdict. This allows anyone to access quality legal representation regardless of their financial situation."
  },
  {
    question: "How long do I have to file a motorcycle accident claim?",
    answer: "Every state has a statute of limitations that sets the deadline for filing a personal injury lawsuit. Most states allow 2-3 years from the date of the accident, but some have shorter windows (as little as 1 year). It's crucial to consult with an attorney as soon as possible to ensure you don't miss your deadline."
  },
  {
    question: "What compensation can I receive for a motorcycle accident?",
    answer: "You may be entitled to compensation for: medical expenses (current and future), lost wages and earning capacity, pain and suffering, property damage, motorcycle repair or replacement, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and in some cases, punitive damages."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I wasn't wearing a helmet during my accident?",
    answer: "This depends on your state's laws and comparative negligence rules. In states without universal helmet laws, not wearing a helmet typically doesn't affect your claim. However, in states requiring helmets, it may reduce your compensation for head injuries. An experienced attorney can explain how this applies to your case."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a motorcycle accident case take to settle?",
    answer: "Settlement timelines vary widely based on case complexity, injury severity, and whether liability is disputed. Simple cases may settle in 3-6 months, while complex cases or those that go to trial can take 1-2 years or more. Your attorney will work to resolve your case as quickly as possible while maximizing your compensation."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I talk to the other driver's insurance company?",
    answer: "We strongly recommend consulting with an attorney before giving any statements to the other driver's insurance company. Insurance adjusters are trained to minimize payouts and may use your words against you. Your attorney can handle all communications with insurance companies on your behalf."
  },
  {
    question: "What if the driver who hit me doesn't have insurance?",
    answer: "If you have uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) coverage on your own policy, you can file a claim against it. This is why UM/UIM coverage is so important for motorcyclists. Your attorney can help you navigate this process and identify all possible sources of compensation."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I still get compensation if I was partially at fault?",
    answer: "Most states follow comparative negligence rules, which means you can still recover damages even if you were partially at fault. However, your compensation may be reduced by your percentage of fault. A few states follow contributory negligence, which can bar recovery if you're found even 1% at fault."
  },
  {
    question: "What should I do immediately after a motorcycle accident?",
    answer: "1) Call 911 and get medical attention. 2) Document the scene with photos and video. 3) Exchange information with other drivers and get witness contacts. 4) Don't admit fault or apologize. 5) Get a copy of the police report. 6) Contact a motorcycle accident attorney before speaking with insurance companies."
  },
  {
    question: "Why do I need a motorcycle accident attorney instead of a regular personal injury lawyer?",
    answer: "Motorcycle accidents involve unique dynamics, injuries, and legal challenges. Riders often face bias from insurance companies and juries who stereotype motorcyclists as reckless. Attorneys who specialize in motorcycle accidents understand these challenges, know the specific laws affecting riders, and can effectively counter anti-rider bias."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I hit a road hazard like a pothole or debris?",
    answer: "You may have a claim against the government entity responsible for road maintenance or the party that created the hazard. These cases have special rules and shorter filing deadlines for government claims. An attorney can help determine if a third party is liable for the road condition that caused your crash."
  },
  {
    question: "How is the value of my motorcycle accident case determined?",
    answer: "Case value depends on several factors: severity of injuries, medical expenses, lost income, impact on quality of life, clarity of fault, insurance coverage available, and strength of evidence. Attorneys use their experience with similar cases to estimate value, but each case is unique."
