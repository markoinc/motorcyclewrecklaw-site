These accidents occur when a car turns left in front of an oncoming motorcycle, often because the driver failed to see the motorcyclist or misjudged their speed." :
                    article.slug.includes('rear-end') ?
                      "Rear-end motorcycle accidents occur when a following vehicle strikes a motorcycle from behind. Unlike rear-end car accidents, which are often minor fender-benders, rear-end motorcycle crashes frequently result in catastrophic injuries because riders have no protection from the impact." :

                      "Lane change accidents are a constant danger for motorcyclists. When drivers fail to check their blind spots or signal their intentions, motorcyclists riding alongside them face sudden, unavoidable collisions. These accidents are particularly frustrating because they're almost entirely preventable with basic driver attention." :
                    article.slug.includes('dooring') ?
                      "Dooring accidents occur when a vehicle occupant opens their door into the path of an oncoming motorcyclist. These sudden obstacles give riders almost no time to react, often resulting in direct impacts with the door or evasive maneuvers that cause crashes." :
                    article.slug.includes('road-hazard') ?
                      "Road hazards that pose minimal threat to cars can be devastating for motorcyclists. Potholes, loose gravel, wet leaves, oil slicks, and debris can cause a motorcycle to lose traction or stability, resulting in crashes that appear to be the rider's fault but actually stem from negligent road maintenance." :
                    article.slug.includes('intersection') ?
                      "Intersections are the most dangerous locations for motorcyclists. Multiple traffic streams, turning vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signals create a complex environment where drivers frequently fail to see motorcycles. Understanding your rights and the common causes of intersection accidents is crucial for any rider." :

                      "Highway motorcycle accidents occur at higher speeds, leading to more severe injuries and fatalities. Merging errors, sudden lane changes, road debris, and fatigue-related crashes are common on highways where motorcyclists are most vulnerable to inattentive drivers." :

                      "Head-on collisions are the deadliest type of motorcycle accident. When a vehicle crosses the center line into a motorcyclist's path, the combined speed of both vehicles creates devastating impact forces. These crashes often result from drunk driving, distracted driving, or driver fatigue." :

                  <h2>Common Causes</h2>
                  <p>
                    These accidents typically result from one or more of the following factors:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Driver Inattention:</strong> Distracted driving, including phone use, eating, or adjusting controls, is a leading cause of motorcycle accidents.</li>
                    <li><strong>Failure to Yield:</strong> Many drivers fail to properly yield the right of way to motorcyclists, especially at intersections and during lane changes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Motorcycle Invisibility:</strong> Motorcycles are smaller and harder to see than cars, especially in mirrors and blind spots.</li>
                    <li><strong>Speed Misjudgment:</strong> Drivers often misjudge the speed of approaching motorcycles, leading to dangerous turning or merging decisions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Impaired Driving:</strong> Alcohol and drug impairment significantly increase the risk of causing motorcycle accidents.</li>
                  </ul>

                      {article.slug.includes('left-turn') ?
                        "In left-turn accidents, the turning driver is found at fault approximately 85% of the time. However, without proper evidence collection, insurance companies may try to shift blame to the motorcyclist." :
                      article.slug.includes('rear-end') ?
                        "The rear driver is presumed at fault in nearly all rear-end accidents. However, proving the full extent of your injuries often requires expert testimony and thorough documentation." :
                        "Motorcyclists are 29 times more likely to die in a crash than car occupants, per mile traveled. This vulnerability is why proving the other driver's negligence is so important for fair compensation."

                  <h2>Determining Fault and Liability</h2>
                  <p>
                    Liability in motorcycle accidents depends on proving negligence—that the other party had a duty of care, breached that duty, and caused your injuries. Key evidence includes:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Police reports documenting the accident</li>
                    <li>Witness statements from people who saw the crash</li>
                    <li>Photos and videos from the scene</li>
                    <li>Traffic camera footage if available</li>
                    <li>Expert accident reconstruction analysis</li>
                    <li>Vehicle damage patterns showing point of impact</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Even if you believe you were partially at fault, you may still be entitled to compensation. Most states use comparative fault systems that allow recovery even when the victim shares some blame.
                  </p>

                  <h2>Common Injuries</h2>
                  <p>

                    <li><strong>Breach of Duty:</strong> Violating traffic laws or driving carelessly constitutes a breach</li>
                    <li><strong>Causation:</strong> You must prove the breach directly caused your injuries</li>
                    <li><strong>Damages:</strong> You must document the actual harm you suffered</li>

In modified comparative fault states, you're typically barred from recovery if you're 50% or 51% or more at fault, depending on the state." :

However, exceptions may apply: the discovery rule can extend deadlines when injuries aren't immediately apparent, and deadlines may be tolled for minors or those with mental incapacity. Government claims often have much shorter notice requirements." :
